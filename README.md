# soundcloud-challenge


This is my shot at the Soundcloud backend developer challenge. 

Functionality is there.

I'd still like to look it over one more time, though: Order the notes and turn them into meaningful documentation, clarify some things in the unit tests (It looks a bit dirty, partly.)

Implementation in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).

Test framework is [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).
